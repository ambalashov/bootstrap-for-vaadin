bootstrap-for-vaadin
====================

Integrating Bootstrap CSS with Vaadin (proof-of-concept).

Using the default bootstrap.css as a base, and then using the default Sass compiler to extend Vaadin class names from the Bootstrap class names. The Vaadin Sass compiler throws a bunch of errors from the Bootstrap CSS at the time of writing, so the default compiler should be used instead.
